# HOIPOI Cinema Boilerplate - first draft

## Cinema capsules

This piece of code is intended to be a first draft of a boilerplate to create a full working distributed network of clients sharing the same audiovisual piece.

## Why?

Because your work want to profit some tecnologies that youtube or vimeo doesn't allow you to explore...

or because you don't want to sign youtube or vimeo licenses,

or because you want to avoid some kind of censorship,

or maybe you want to promote a hype without die-by-ddos. 

## How?

By using github pages, webtorrent.io and instant.io you can create a project webpage that generate a p2p network to distribute your audiovisual work in minutes
